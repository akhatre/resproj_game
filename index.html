                We would like to invite you to participate in this research project
                directed by researchers at UCL. You should only participate if you want
                to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way.
                Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you
                to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others
                if you wish. Do not hesitate to ask the researcher if there is anything
                that is not clear or if you would like more information
                (<a href="mailto:akhat.rakishev.14@ucl.ac.uk">akhat.rakishev.14@ucl.ac.uk</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                In this experiment, you will play a browser-based computer game as part of
                a research project into human decision-making. The game should be very enjoyable.
                Your goal will be to catch as many fish as you can. To do that, you would need to predict were fish school will go on
                the next day of your fishing. There are more fish in the centre of the school, so the more accurate your prediction is,
                the more fish you will get.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The approximate duration of this study is <strong>15 minutes.</strong> </li>
                <li>The maximum allowed duration is 35 minutes. If you exceed this time, you can no longer complete the study.</li>
<!--
                <li>You will be paid <strong>at least £2</strong> upon successful completion,
                    no matter how well you do, or how long you take.</li>
                <li>If you perform well, you will also <strong>get a chance of winning amazon voucher</strong>
                    the chance of winning the voucher will depend on how well you performed in relation to other players.</li>
-->
                <li>The fish school constantly changes its position.</li>
                <li>The rate of those changes, however, may also change, so that on certain days fish school would not move far away, while on
                other days it may move all around the map. Just like real fish do. Amateur fisher never precisely knows were it goes.</li>

                <li><strong>Important:</strong> the experiment has been carefully designed to work with all
                    modern browsers on a computer. However, 
                    you need a device with mouse or touchpad to play the game. You cannot use touch screen to play the game</li>

                <li><strong>Also, you need a display with width of at least 800 pixels. </strong> If you do not know your screen width its fine, as it is checked automatically. </li>

                <li> <strong>Acceptance of submissions:</strong> Ordinarily all research participants that complete a study are paid at least
                    the minimum sign-up reward. However, we check responses carefully to make sure that participants are human beings,
                    read the instructions and do not cheat. If you try to cheat or share sensitive information about
                    this study on online forums, your submission <strong>will</strong> be rejected.</li>

                <li>Please also take into account that in this study, you can earn substantially more than the minimum amount
                    if you perform well. This is only possible if you read the instructions carefully. </li>
